<body><p>1. Imported pandas to do analysis on the dataset

2. Stored the dataset into the dataframe. Read the dataset and used the pipe symbol as a separator so that the columns would be more readable.

3. Get all the columns from the dataset and put it into a list so that I could read through the list and determine medical codexes.

4. Extracting individual columns from the dataframe.

5. Counts the unique values that appear within the columns from the previous step and then prints out how many repeated counts appear for each unique value.

6. Identifying null/missing values within each column and printing out how many total missing values are within each column.

7. Filling in "MISSING" into the rows with missing values.

8. Use the top 5 counts of unique values from each column and print them out for their respective columns.

9. I chose to find patterns within patients who had kidney transplants with diagnostic code '2940'.

10. The first one was finding the most common procedures performed on these patients. The procedures were all transplants of the either the right or left kidney.

11. Secondly, the most common HCPCS codes for these patients was found. The most common HCPCS code found was a replacement for the socket portion of an above knee prosthetic limb.

12. Lastly, the most common claims DRG codes for these patients was found. The most common claims DRG code for these patients was that the admission for these patients into the hospital was not primarily due to illness but due to other health status factors.<p><body>
